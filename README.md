**About the challenge:**

Clicking pictures through smartphones can be fun and give us a good nostalgic trip at times, but it all comes at a cost. Storage Space! Do you think you can use your python skills to make sure you have all the photos but at a reduced size so it's not taking up a lot of your storage? If you can, this challenge is for you!


**Challenge:** 

- Use OpenCV Package to compress the size of at least 50 pictures in a folder in your desktop, and make each picture less than 100 KiloBytes in size. You can use any images to complete this challenge.

## Demo
![demo](https://github.com/yashppawar/COTW-9/blob/main/assets/demo.png?raw=true)
Before compression the size was: 153MB (size of folder)
After compression the size is: 1.04MB (size of folder)
